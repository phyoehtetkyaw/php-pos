# Point of Sale - PHP
The project aims to develop a comprehensive Point of Sale (POS) system leveraging PHP's Object-oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This system will facilitate efficient transaction management, inventory tracking, and sales analysis for businesses. It will utilize MySQL as the database management system to store and manage transactional data. The user interface will be designed using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a modern and responsive design. Additionally, the system will be containerized with Docker, allowing for easy deployment and scalability across different environments.
